    "- An Ethereum-based cryptocollectibles game that allows players to breed digital cats using smart contracts\n",
    "- It caused major disruptions to the Ethereum network and caused delays in the implementation of a number of Ethereum-based cryptocurrency ICO smart contracts. \n",
    "\n",
    "### EtherWarfare\n",

    "\n",
    "- A medieval-themed virtual game that runs on the Ethereum blockchain. \n",
    "- The game is another instalment in the cryptocollectibles ecosystem that thrives to create a marketplace for virtual items while enjoying a game at the same time. \n",
    "- EtherWarfare builds upon much of what has been established by the Cryptokitties game. \n",
    "- It even uses the same type of ERC-721 tokens that are used in the Cryptokitties game. ERC-721 tokens are non-fungible.\n",

    "\n",
    "- The Ethereum blockchain isn’t the only blockchain that supports games as there are also games built on the Bitcoin blockchain. \n",
    "- A cross between a trading card game and a classic arcade feature.\n",
    "- Spells of Genesis was developed by EverdreamSoft, a Swiss-based company.\n",
    "- Touted as being the first card trading game built to run on the Bitcoin blockchain. \n",
    "- A nod to the popular Yu-Gi-Oh and Magic the Gathering strategy card games.\n",

    "## Economic Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- The game industry runs on several systems that rely on central authorities. \n",
    "- Blockchains have the potential to disrupt these\n",
    "- The current Free-to-Play economic model looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*CuXausHFucMs2N5cmo-ICg.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- The Ad Networks and the App Stores are the central entities from which value flows in and out of. \n",
    "- Value in this case is ‘fiat currency’, meaning any currency backed by a government, like US Dollars\n",
    "- This value is earned by a Game Developer whenever a Player pays via an in-app purchase or watches an ad.\n",
    "- Has been the standard for the past few years, and consequently has been a powerful economic force that influences game design.\n",
    "- Twitch games that show an ad every few seconds are optimized for this ecosystem.\n",
    "- Gacha games that make use of opaque Loot Box percentages, similarly, are designed for players to spend a lot of fiat currency in in-app purchases or microtransactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What if developers are able to decentralize value away from Ad Networks and App Stores, and instead design the economy themselves?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Blockchains and Smart Contracts provide that option. The Ethereum Blockchain, in particular, allows developers to create their own cryptocurrency, as well as define the rules that allow the cryptocurrency to flow across users.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Lets create an ERC20 Token to be able to create a game economy where players are able to freely transfer value to their peers, and also in the future be able to take that value out of the ecosystem if they wanted. \n",
    "\n",

    "### Step 1 - Create Wallets Using Metamask\n",
    "- Lets create a Wallet that will deploy the Token Contract that creates our Token. \n",
    "- This Wallet will also initially hold all the tokens that will be created by the Contract.\n",
    "- Lets create a Wallet via the Metamask Chrome Browser Extension.\n",
    "- Let’s install the extension from the Metamask site and create a Metamask account.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*_e0yOsPqrUgqQv7xidGX7Q.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- We can see that Metamask has already created a Wallet for us called ‘Account 1’. We’ll be using this Wallet to deploy the Contract in Step 2.\n",
    "- Let’s also create another Wallet which we’ll use to test for transferring Ether (ETH) and our created Token. \n",
    "- Lets rename the Wallets to ‘Bank’ and ‘User’ for easier reference\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2 - Create Token Contract Using Remix\n",
    "\n",
    "- Lets deploy a Token Contract on the Ethereum Blockchain using the Remix IDE\n",
    "- we will need to have ETH to pay for the transaction fee. \n",
    "- Lets skip that. For this whole process we’ll be using the Ropsten Test Network (free)\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*YxVf17_glSDmGt7zPXrKGQ.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now we can get ETH from the metamask faucet by simply clicking the BUY button. \n",
    "- This will redirect us to faucet.metamask.io, where we can easily obtain 1 ETH by pressing the ‘request 1 ether from faucet’ button. \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*Q1N7mGwLi1HeTFWMX4wJZQ.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Now we can start using Remix to deploy our Token Contract \n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wV9n3vVRTlhVA1wDThIFPw.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- We’ll replace the source code here with ethereum.org/token\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*iIm2TdXld0AJdiey2TMtoA.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- We deploy  by pressing the ‘Create’ button on the ‘Run’ tab after specifying the constructor parameters defined by the contract; \n",
    "- in this case, initialSupply, tokenName and tokenSymbol\n",
    "- we'll see a Metamask pop-up asking us to confirm the transaction. \n",
    "- We Click ‘Submit’ on the pop-up to start deploying the contract.\n",
    "- Once the contract has been deployed, we can then add the new token to be tracked in Metamask. \n",
    "- we'll need to get our Contract Address, which we can get from Etherscan. We copy paste this address in Metamask to start tracking the token, as shown below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3- Create Player Wallets Using Nethereum + Unity3D\n",
    "\n",
    "- we’ll be creating wallets for the players on our game through code using Nethereum, a C# integration library that can be used in Unity3D.\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have a sample project called unity3d-blockchain-wallet over at Github for all the Unity3D code that we need for the next steps. \n",
    "- It used code from the Nethereum github and from Experimental’s Nethereum examples.\n",
    "- We can open it in the Unity Editor\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*p07UvbPnMIvO_3Q9uhekIA.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once in Unity Editor, we first need to change the Token Contract Address variable in the Token Contract Service component. \n",
    "- Select the [ManagerComponents] Game Object in the Hierarchy View, and change the Token Contract Address on the Inspector View to the Contract Address of the new token that we created on Step 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*RzyI-yDVl6BPP5s8FmsHRA.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- If our Contract Address is correct, we should see the correct Name, Symbol and other details in the app once we run it in the Unity Editor.\n",
    "- In code, we use Nethereum’s EthCallUnityRequest to retrieve the Token details. \n",
    "- The relevant source can be found in the GetTokenInfo function of TokenContractService.cs.\n",
    "- Once we have the correct Token Address, we can start creating our Player Wallets. \n",
    "- To do this in unity3d-blockchain-wallet, we first need to input and confirm a password in the Password fields, and then push the ‘Create Wallet’ button.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*wDsT71kXvdZdf5yHNUIRTw.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- Once the Wallet is created, we’ll see the Wallet’s public address shown on the Wallet selection dropdown at the top of the app.\n",
    "- Let’s create another account by choosing ‘New Wallet’ from the dropdown, and once again creating a Wallet. \n",
    "- We'll then see a total of two accounts on our Wallet selection dropdown\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*nRlZGkxtU8FyDhyMwF57zA.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "- we’ll be using the Copy to Clipboard button, we'll click that to copy the first account’s public address\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*gtFvRZiGVvXstgZWb_ESMQ.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 4 - Send ETH Using Metamask\n",
    "\n",
    "- We’ll go back to Metamask and use that to transfer ETH to two wallets: the User Wallet we created in Step 1 and to the first player Wallet whose public address we just copied to the clipboard in Step 3. \n",
    "- After sending ETH to our User Wallet, let’s also send ETH to the player Wallet we created using unity3d-blockchain-wallet. \n",
    "- Select our Bank Wallet from Metamask, and then press the ‘Send’ button again. \n",
    "- This time though instead of choosing the Recipient Address via the dropdown, copy paste the public address that we copied to our clipboard via unity3d-blockchain-wallet.\n",
    "- Once the transaction is completed, let’s go back to the Unity Editor and run the app. We should see that our account now has the ETH transferred from our Bank Wallet.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*vjELBnRO_ql4i0td6uRsHQ.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 5 - Send Tokens Using Metamask + wallet.ethereum.org\n",
    "\n",
    "- We’ll now transfer our created Tokens from the Bank Wallet to both the User Wallet and to the Player Wallet. \n",
    "- Metamask doesn’t have the functionality to send custom tokens, so we’ll be using wallet.ethereum.org with Metamask for wallet authentication\n",
    "- the website will display its details automatically on the Accounts section.\n",
    "- We need to click on the Contracts Tab, and then the ‘Watch Token’ button at the bottom. \n",
    "- Input our Token’s Contract Address on the field and press OK.\n",
    "- After adding our Token, we can then start sending it to other accounts by using the Send Tab. \n",
    "- From here we’ll be able to select our Token from a Dropdown list and send it to other accounts, similarly to how we do it on Metamask.\n",
    "- Let’s transfer Tokens from our Bank Wallet to the User Wallet and the Player Wallet\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*tsmVgtPwSTOU_52_0SWFMA.png \"Logo Title Text 1\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 6 Send Tokens Using Nethereum + Unity3D\n",
    "\n",
    "- Finally, we’ll now use Unity3D to send funds peer to peer from one Player Wallet to another. \n",
    "- Select the other Wallet on the Recipient Address Dropdown. We then input how much Custom Token we want to transfer, and then press Send.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s all! \n",
    "\n",
